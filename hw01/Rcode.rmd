#### Explaination-1
I use the first chunk of code to generate a greeting line with strings.

```{r chunk1}
greeting <- "Good Morning,"
name <- "Yihan"
message <- paste(greeting, name)
print(message)
```


#### Explaination-2
I use the second chunk of code to calculate the add up of x and y.

```{r chunk2}
x<-2
y<-3
print(x+y)
```
