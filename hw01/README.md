#### A Descriptive Summary of the GitHub Workflow

1.  First, I loged in GitHub classroom css-fall23 to accept hw01, and
    created the specific private repository link of hw01 on GitHub.  
2.  Next, I created a New Project under File tab in RWorkbench to clone
    the hw01 repository. I select File&gt;New Project&gt;Version
    Control&gt;Git, and copy the SSH link of the hw01 created in last
    step to Git. By doing so, I cloned the hw01 to my local workbench
    and I stored it in my MACS30500-HW directory. This leads me to a new
    session, where I could start my editing.  
3.  Then, I edited the README.md file in my local Rworkbench according
    to the instructions and tutorials.  
4.  After all the edition and debug, I saved the changes.  
5.  Finally, I committed the changes to my local Git, and pushed the
    files back to GitHub repository, where my hw01 is located in
    css-fall23.  

#### Evaluation

Iâ€™ve learned a lot this week, especially working with GitHub in R
Studio. I used to operate R only locally on my own computer, but by
practicing connecting RWorkbench and GitHub, I can easily save all the
changes I made to a central repository. Working with GitHub make the
files organized because of I know where to find my files. Also, I
learned what is Markdown files, and how to use them. I have no
experience with using .md file before, but I practiced the format and
edited .md file myself. I feel Markdown is an essential tool to record
commentary and help communication. Since .md files contain text
information, we can use them to further explain data analysis/results in
.r files in real cases.Also, presentation with Markdown files looks more clean and straightforward, which leads to clean data analysis report with a good look.
