#### Explaination-1

I use the first chunk of code to generate a greeting line with strings.

    greeting <- "Good Morning,"
    name <- "Yihan"
    message <- paste(greeting, name)
    print(message)

    ## [1] "Good Morning, Yihan"

#### Explaination-2

I use the second chunk of code to calculate the add up of x and y.

    x<-2
    y<-3
    print(x+y)

    ## [1] 5
