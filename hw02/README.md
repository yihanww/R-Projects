# Homework 02: Exploring and visualizing data

Consult our webpage under HW02 for detailed instructions about this homework assignment.

## Required packages

You should have the following packages installed (already installed on R Workbench):

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(rcis)
```

## Assignment submission

Follow the instructions on our website under HW02 to submit your homework and check which files should be submitted.

For your benefit, this repo includes a starter R Markdown document (`mass-shootings.Rmd`). **Do not rename this document and do not delete what is already in there, only add on to it** and add your name in the YAML header as indicated in the document. 

The [`demo`](demo/) folder includes a minimal example solution (`mass-shootings-solution.md`). This file does not contain the code necessary to complete the homework, but does show you output from R for potential solutions. **Your solutions do not need to perfectly replicate these potential solutions**, especially for the last open-ended question, but they are a good starting point.

## Assignment Re-submission

For the re-submission, I made some changes to improve the report according to my feedback on Canvas. 

For Coding Style, I was confused about how YAML worked in md files, and there were also some useless comments in the code chunks. Therefore, for the re-submission, I remove those useless comments inside code chunks, and edited my YAML header to make the final report clean. I also add spaces between codes for a more concise coding style. 

For Coding Strategy, I added a bar chart in Open-ended Questions #1 because the question count the number of two conditions of mental states, and a barplot represents the number in a more clear way. 

For Representation, my feedback suggested that I should add further customization to the graphs. So for the resubmission, I add more colors and customization to the original graphs. I also changed the codes to calculate the number of mass shooting cases cased by white male with mental illness signs using the nrow function to make the report more direct and clear in Specific Questions #1.
